\title{Find the closest CDEC gage}
\usage{
calcNearestCDEC(
  df,
  cdecGPS = deltadata::CDECGPS,
  cdecMetadata = deltadata::CDECMetadata,
  variable = c("temp", "turbidity", "ec"),
  waterColumn = c("top", "bottom")
)
}
\arguments{
\item{df}{A data frame that contains at least the lat/lon of station(s) of
interest, named as \code{lat} and \code{lon}.}

\item{cdecGPS}{A data frame containing the GPS coordinates of the CDEC gages
of interest, as \code{lat} and \code{lon}.}

\item{cdecMetadata}{A data frame containing the metadata table of the CDEC
gages of interest. This table must match the format provided by the DWR
website. It is recommended to use \code{pullMetadataCDEC()} to get this data.}

\item{variable}{The water quality variable of interest. Currently only
supports water temperature as \code{temp}, turbidity as \code{turbidity}, and
electro-conductivity as \code{ec}. This defaults to water temperature.}

\item{waterColumn}{Where in the water column should the variable of interest
be prioritized? Supports only \code{top} and \code{bottom}, defaulting to \code{top}. For
now, top data will be used in the calculation even if you ask for bottom
data.}
}
\value{
A data frame of the metadata of the closest CDEC station to your
point of interest that has data for the variable of interest.
}
\description{
Identifies the nearest CDEC gage to a lat/lon of interest. This function
requires metadata of all CDEC stations of interest. By default, all CDEC
stations are used.

\examples{
\dontrun{
df <- data.frame(station = "306", lat = 38.00064, lon = -122.4136)
