\title{Identify stations that are more than \code{d} distance in miles, defaulting to
0.5, away from the theoretical coordinate.}
\usage{
gpsOutlier(df, d = 0.5)
}
\arguments{
\item{df}{A dataframe with 6 required columns: date, station, legend, layer,
lat, and lon. See \code{plotGPS()} for details.}

\item{d}{Miles threshold to call a coordinate outlying. This distance is
measured as the crow flies.}
}
\value{
A data frame with all outlying coordinates.
